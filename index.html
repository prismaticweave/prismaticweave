        <p class="tagline">Empowering humanity through thoughtful technology</p>
        <p class="additional-text">I'm Killianâ€”a creative technology enthusiast working at the intersection of ethical design and boundless curiosity. I like to design experiences and aim to build frameworks that challenge the assumptions of dominant systems - and carve out space for others. My background spans narrative structure, technical implementation, and digital privacy, all grounded in an unwavering commitment to help others. I care deeply about empowering people to navigate, fortify, and reshape their digital environments. At the heart of my work is the conviction that technology should create space for connection, creativity, and collective empowerment.</p>
