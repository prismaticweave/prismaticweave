      <h1>Compost & Cultivate</h1>
      <p>I'm Killian—a creative technologist working at the intersection of ethical design, speculative systems, and boundless curiosity. I build tools, experiences, and frameworks that challenge the assumptions of dominant systems and carve out space for others to create, reclaim, or exist.</p>
      <p>My background spans narrative structure, technical implementation, and digital privacy—all grounded in an unwavering commitment to help others. I care deeply about empowering people to navigate, fortify, and reshape their digital environments—whether through accessible privacy tools, vibrant storytelling, or purpose-driven experimentation.</p>
      <p>My work is guided by a simple principle: if something isn't serving people, it's time to compost it—and cultivate something radically better.</p>
